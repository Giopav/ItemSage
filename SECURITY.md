The version that receives constant updates is always the [latest](https://github.com/Giopav/ItemSage/releases).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You just found a Vulnerability in my project?

No worries, you can report them in two ways.
1) Write an email to giopav012@gmail.com and receive an answer in 1-3 days.
2) Send a message to @Giopav on telegram and expect an answer in 1-3 days.

I always try to answer reports even if a vulnerability has been declined, 
therefore if I read it and don't answer I'm probably working on it.

If you are having any kind of problem don't be shy and reach out to me! I would really appreciate it.
